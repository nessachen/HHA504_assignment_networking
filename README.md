- I went to GCP and searched for VPC networks. Then, I pressed Then, I pressed create and started setting the configurations. For the name, I wanted it to reflect the homework assignment. I left MTU as its default option of 1460 and subnet creation mode as its default option of custom, while leaving pricate IPv6 address settings checkbox as unselected. Next, for subnets, I set the name to reflect the homework assignment and chose the region as east US. I left the IP stack type as IPv4 and made the range as 10.0.0.0/24. For the remaining options of private google access, flow logs, and hybrid subet, I left them all as the default option of off. In the firewall rules section, I did not select any of the options because I was not sure what they implied and thought it was best to leave it untouched. Furthermore, for dyanmic routing mode, I left it as refional and chose the default option of legacy for best path selection mode. After pressing create, the VPC network successfully deployed.
### Azure

- I went to the Azure portal and searched for virtual networks. Then, I pressed create and started setting the configurations. I made sure it was under the correct subscription and resource group. For the name, I wanted it to reflect the homework assignment and chose the region as East US. Next, for the secruity configurations, I did not select any of the options because I was scared to incur extra cost. Furthermore, for IP addresses, I left it as the default options of 10.0.0.0/16 and 10.0.0.0. And, I did not input any tags for the virtual network. After pressing create, the virual network successfully deployed.

## 2. Assign a Dedicated IP

- After creating the VPC network, I went to create the VM instance as we learned in class and I realized the pages to set configurations looked different than before. For the name, I wanted it to reflect the homework assignment. Then, I chose a east US region and left any as the option for zone. I changed the VM provisioning model to spot, selected delete for on VM termination, and left host error timeout as the default option of unspecified. Next, for machine configuration, I left the series as E2 but changed e2-medium to e2-micro. Under OS and storage, I made sure to change the image type to Ubuntu. For networking, the layout of the page appears different than before. I am assuming it is due to creating the VPC network in the previous step. I selected the options of allowing HTTPS and HTTP traffic for firewall while leaving the other configurations as unselected until network interfaces. I was permitted to choose the dropdown and select the VPC network and subnetwork created in the previous step. It was really interesting how in the same section I was also able to reserve a static external IP address and I made the name of the static external IP address reflect the homework assignment. After that, for the remaining fields, I left them either as the default options or as unselected and then pressed create, which allowed for successful deployment.
### Azure

- After creating the virtual network, I searched public IP addresses. I pressed create and started setting the configurations. I made sure it was under the correct subscription and resource group. For the name, I wanted it to reflect the homework assignment and I left the IP version as the default option of IPv4. Then, for SKU, I chose the basic option instead of standard and left the IP address assignment as static. For DNS name label, I was not sure what to input so I left it blank. Next, for idle timeout (minutes) and domain name label scope (preview), I left them as the default configurations of 4 minutes and none. After pressing create, the public IP address successfully deployed. However, I am not sure if I correctly completed this step because I reread the instructions and it said to create the static public IP address for a resource within the VNet. And, I am not sure how to accurately execute the steps needed to precisely create the static public IP address for a resource within the VNet because for the last homework assignment we were unable to create a virtual machine on Azure.

## 3. Map IP to a Domain

- After creating the VM instance and assigned the IP, I searched for cloud DNS and I actually had to enable it first. Then, I pressed create and started with leaving the zone type as public. For zone name and DNS name, I wanted it to reflect the homework assignment. Next, for DNSSEC and cloud logging, I left them both as the default options of off and pressed create. For mapping an IP to a domain, I was not sure what steps to take to complete the task so I tried researching for resources and will assume that I took the right steps to map the IP to the domain. The next thing I did was press add standard on the cloud DNS page. I was then prompted to enter a DNS name and all I did was input `www`. For the remaining sections of resource record type, TTL, and TTL unit I left them as the default options. When it came to the field of IPv4 address 1, I was able to press select and choose the IP address created from making the VPC network and VM instance. Notably, to complete the homework assignment, I found GCP to be really straightforward but at the same time I think I might have completed the wrong steps for the Azure portion.

- After creating the public IP address, I searched DNS zones. I pressed create and started setting the configurations. I made sure it was under the correct subscription and resource group. For the name, I wanted it to reflect the homework assignment. Then, when reaching the next page of DNS zone editor, it said to upload a DNS zone file and copy my DNS zone into line 1. I am not sure how to complete the prompts on the DNS zone editor page and the purpose of the prompts, though I would assume it would help map the IP address to a domain. I tried researching for resources that could help me complete this step, but I still remain confused on how to map the IP address to a domain using the DNS zone feature.
